# OSlash is now open source and free forever!

After a three-year journey of solving workplace information discovery, we’re sunsetting OSlash. Despite the lack of commercial success, we’ve been lucky to cultivate dedicated power users who love the product and can’t imagine working without their favorite OSlash shortcuts.

As a token of our gratitude, we’re releasing an open source extension for OSlash shortcuts.

You can continue using your OSlash shortcuts by importing them into this extension, latest by `29th November 2023`.

### What is OSlash?

OSlash is an open source browser extension that allows you to transform your most frequently used links (for example: `meet.google.com/tmk-iewh-pkp`) into simple, human-readable, and easy-to-remember shortcuts such as `o/meet-john` or `o/standup`.

### Why did we build OSlash?

Today, all important information at work resides in the cloud. This means that every important resource, file, or document is a link. Like you, we were tired of digging through our emails, Slack threads, and conversations for links every time we needed answers.
Links are long, complex, and messy. Links get lost and buried in piles of more links. Links are tough to remember and share.

So, we replaced them with OSlash shortcuts (or `o/shortcuts`) to make them more accessible, discoverable, and shareable. 


### How to install OSlash?

To install the open source extension, please follow these steps:

1. Start by downloading the OSlash [ZIP file](https://github.com/getoslash/oslash/releases) to your local drive and then extract its contents into a designated folder.
2. Open your Chrome browser.
3. Access the extensions management page by entering `chrome://extensions` into the Chrome address bar and pressing Enter.
4. In the top right corner of the extensions page, toggle the switch to enable "Developer mode."
5. With developer mode activated, click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
6. Navigate to the location where you extracted the OSlash extension files and select the folder.
7. After the folder is loaded, you should see the OSlash extension in your list of installed extensions.
8. To have quick access to OSlash, locate it in the extensions list and click the `pin` icon, so it appears in your browser's toolbar.

### How to start creating and using OSlash shortcuts?

- Go to the page for which you want to create a shortcut. 
Click on the pinned OSlash extension.
- The URL of the page will be auto-populated in the dialog box
Next, add the shortcut name and save. We recommend you pick a short, memorable, and recognizable shortcut name. 
- Your shortcut is now available! Close the dialog box and test it out by typing `o/<shortcut-name>` in a new tab or window.
