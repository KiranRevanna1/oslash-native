## Objective

We are developing an open source version of the proprietary OSlash Shortcuts / GoLinks Alternative.
This would be a browser extension which can be used to convert web-urls into short links/shortcuts and access them.
The goal is to enable users to quickly manage and access all of their important links/websites.

### What is an o/ (pronounced as OSlash) shortcut ?
An o/ shortcut is a short keyword that can be entered directly into your browser’s address bar to quickly access web resources.

### How to use o/ shortcuts ?
o/ shortcuts can be used by first installing a browser extension in your browser. Then one can add the url and their associated o/ shortcut via the browser extension UI interface.
Once saved, this o/ shortcut can then be entered directly into the browser’s address bar by the user.

## Motivation

Purpose of releasing this open source version is to give out a minimal and stable release of OSlash Shortcuts.
